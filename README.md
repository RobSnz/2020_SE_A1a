## Software Engineering Evidence Repository (SEER)

SEER is a MERN stack-built web application that can be used as a searchable database to find academic articles that relate to software engineering. Any user can effectively search for articles relating to software engineering, while there are also extra functionalities that are limited to certain users. These include 'submitters' requesting to upload a new academic article, 'moderators' who validate submitted articles and 'analysts' who review and add key values about any moderated articles. Once an article has been analysed it can then be successfully searched for on the system.
